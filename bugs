- No concurrent database connections

- After using Update Database button connection to database is not closed,
therefore a new connection to database cannot be established due to the concurrent connections bug (No explicit errors are thrown, only JdbcSQLException log)

- When deleting student it is offered to choose the student by name, not by phone number. If there are 2 students with the same name, they both can be selected.

-Update database function in web app currently doesn't work with .xlsx files, works only with .xls.
