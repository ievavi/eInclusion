lubuntu:
Got to directory: cd workspace/Einclusion/
Run command: mvn
Run command: mvn clean compile assembly:single
Got to directory: cd target/
Run command: java -jar Einclusion-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies

If something wrong happens:
Got to directory: cd workspace/Einclusion/
Run command: mvn clean
Check if target folder is deleted from Einclusion folder
Or contact jar master Beatrise :D
